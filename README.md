# textedit

A little fun project. In the end, this will be a basic text editor without anything fancy. It can save and load files, that's it. Maybe I'll add some syntax highlighting. Goal is to have a working editor after 24 work hours and then be done with the project. I'll add as many [features](features.md) as I can in that time frame.
